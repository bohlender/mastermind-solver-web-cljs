# A web frontend for a Mastermind solver
This repository is an experiment in
- using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) & [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent), and
- calling native code compiled to WASM

to create a web frontend for [a SAT-based Mastermind solver](https://github.com/bohlender/mastermind-solver).
